Program Description:
This program works on your computer's command line to help you manage a list of parts. It lets you add, delete, and view items in the list directly through the command line.
When you start the program you need to give it the name of the list as an input. It uses a simple menu where you can choose what you want to do by typing your input.

The program menu looks like this:
Menu:
1. Print all records
2. Add record
3. Delete the last record
4. Print number of records
5. Print database size
6. Print number of changes
7. Exit
Users input a number to select an option. The program executes the function then returns to the menu until the user chooses to exit.
